## Libraries

The lib directory contains utility functions, helper classes, and other reusable code that provide common functionality used throughout your application. These files serve as building blocks for your application logic and encapsulate functionality that can be reused across multiple parts of your codebase.

The lib folder typically contains more specialized or complex utility functions, classes, or modules that provide specific functionality or interact with external systems. Here are some characteristics of the lib folder:

1. Specialized Functionality: Libraries in the lib folder may offer more specialized or domain-specific functionality. For example, they may include API clients, authentication handlers, data parsers, or integration modules for external services.

2. External Dependencies: Libraries in the lib folder may depend on external libraries or services. They often encapsulate complex logic or interactions with external systems, such as databases, APIs, or third-party services.

3. Higher Level of Abstraction: Libraries in the lib folder may provide a higher level of abstraction compared to utility functions in the utils folder. They may encapsulate complex business logic or system integrations, making them more specialized and less reusable in different contexts.

Follow an example of code for this directory:

```
// lib/storage.ts

export const setItem = (key: string, value: string): void => {
  // Set an item in local storage
  localStorage.setItem(key, value);
};

export const getItem = (key: string): string | null => {
  // Get an item from local storage
  return localStorage.getItem(key);
};

export const removeItem = (key: string): void => {
  // Remove an item from local storage
  localStorage.removeItem(key);
};
```
